## Important

I created this package to use passport with discord,
**This repo is a fork** of the generic Oauth2 strategy [passport-oauth2](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-oauth2#readme)
by jaredhanson and all credits go to his owner at this point. I simply changed a couple of lines for this to work with discord.
